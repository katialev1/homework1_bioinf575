### Repo for homework1 bioinf575

#### This is a repository to test conflicts by recreating the TP53 gene sequence in a file

The TP53 gene information is available at:   
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157

> "This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms." 


The TP53 gene sequence is available at:      
[NCBI TP53 sequence in text format](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000017.11?report=fasta&log$=seqview&format=text&from=7668421&to=7687490&strand=true)

To get started, I added the first line to the **TP53_sequence.txt** file and it is the first line at the link above   
> \>NC_000017.11:c7687490-7668421 Homo sapiens chromosome 17, GRCh38.p14 Primary Assembly


**Each student should edit the *TP53_sequence.txt* file in this repository and add a line of the TP53 gene sequence to it.**       
For instance, if you are adding information on the 4<sup>th</sup> line, add the 4<sup>th</sup> line from the gene sequence at the link above.
